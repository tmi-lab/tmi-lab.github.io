  abstractnote = {Dementia is a progressive condition that affects cognitive and functional abilities. There is a need for reliable and continuous health monitoring of People Living with Dementia (PLWD) to improve their quality of life and support their independent living. Healthcare services often focus on addressing and treating already established health conditions that affect PLWD. Managing these conditions continuously can inform better decision-making earlier for higher-quality care management for PLWD. The Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) project developed a new digital platform to routinely collect longitudinal, observational, and measurement data, within the home and apply machine learning and analytical models for the detection and prediction of adverse health events affecting the well-being of PLWD. This work describes the TIHM dataset collected during the second phase (i.e., feasibility study) of the TIHM project. The data was collected from homes of 56 PLWD and associated with events and clinical observations (daily activity, physiological monitoring, and labels for health-related conditions). The study recorded an average of 50 days of data per participant, totalling 2803 days.},

  desc={People living with dementia commonly sleep poorly at night, and this often occurs before they are diagnosed with dementia. We investigated whether a sleep sensor placed under a person’s mattress could monitor sleep activity in people with dementia without disrupting their normal daily routines and behaviour. We compared sleep data collected from both people with dementia and the general population to identify whether differences could be detected. We found identifiable dementia-related sleep patterns, suggesting sleep sensors could be used both to monitor disease and more generally in research. In the future, using these types of sensors could enable better care for people living with dementia by monitoring their sleep.}

  desc={People with dementia experience changes in behaviour, independence and memory that impacts their own lives and the lives of the people who care for them. We study how living with dementia affects daily life and well-being after dementia diagnosis. In total, 141 people with dementia participated in the study. Study participants and their carers answered questions about daily activities, mental health, and cognitive abilities every 3 months. We found that behavioural changes and challenges in daily tasks for people with dementia are affected as memory and thinking skills decline. Carers of people with mild symptoms of dementia reported higher levels of stress, while people with more severe symptoms relied more on community services, with a lower number of hospital visits. These findings offer insights to improve dementia care and support services.}

Through explainability techniques, we identified actionable factors associated with agitation episodes, including sleep patterns, ambient light, and temperature. To facilitate the design of personalised non-pharmacological interventions, we propose an interactive interface that allows users to simulate changes in environmental factors and observe their impact on the model's agitation probability estimates. This interface features adjustable sliders for ambient modifiable factors, such as lighting and temperature, enabling careful planning of individualised care strategies.},
